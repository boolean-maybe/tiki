# tiki

Keep your tickets in your pockets!

`tiki` refers to a task or a ticket (hence tiki) stored in your **git** repo

- like a ticket it can have a status, priority, assignee, points, type and multiple tags attached to it
- they are essentially just Markdown files and you can use full Markdown syntax to describe a story or a bug
- they are stored in `.doc/tiki` subdirectory and are **git**-controlled - they are added to **git** when they are created,
  removed when they are done and the entire history is preserved in **git** repo
- because they are in **git** they can be perfectly synced up to the state of your repo or a branch
- you can use either the `tiki` CLI tool or any of the AI coding assistant to work with your tikis

## tiki format

Tiki stores tickets (aka tikis) and documents (aka dokis) in the git repo along with code
They are stored under `.doc` directory and are supposed to be checked-in/versioned along with all other files

The `.doc/` directory contains two main subdirectories:
- **doki/**: Documentation files (wiki-style markdown pages)
- **tiki/**: Task files (kanban style tasks with YAML frontmatter)

## Directory Structure

## Tiki files

Tiki files are saved in `.doc/tiki` directory and can be managed via:

- `tiki` cli
- AI tools such as `claude`, `codex` or `opencode`
- manually

A tiki is made of its frontmatter that includes all fields related to a tiki status and types and its description
in Markdown format

```text
        ---
        title: Sample title
        type: story
        status: backlog
        assignee: booleanmaybe
        priority: 3
        points: 10
        tags:
            - UX
            - test
        dependsOn:
            - TIKI-ABC123
            - TIKI-DEF456
        ---
        
        This is the description of a tiki in Markdown:
        
        # Tests
        Make sure all tests pass
        
        ## Integration tests
        Integration test cases
```

### dependsOn

The `dependsOn` field is a list of tiki IDs (`TIKI-XXXXXX` format) that this task depends on.
A dependency means this tiki is blocked by or requires the listed tikis.
Values must be valid tiki IDs referencing existing tikis. The field is optional and defaults to empty.

### Derived fields

Fields such as:
- `created by`
- `created at`
- `updated at`

are not stored and are calculated from git - the time and git user who created a tiki or the time it was last modified


## Doki files

Documents are any file in a Markdown format saved under `.doc/doki` directory. They can be organized in subdirectory
tree and include links between them or to external Markdown files
