# Epic: Explore Automation Opportunities

This is just a sample tiki - feel free to remove!

## Strategic Vision

> Systematically identify and automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks across the organization to free up team capacity for high-value creative and strategic work.

## Opportunity Areas

### 1. Report Generation

**Current state:** Manual compilation from multiple sources
**Automation potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Estimated time savings:** 8 hours/week

| Report Type | Frequency | Manual Effort | Automation Complexity |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Weekly status | Weekly | 2 hours | Low |
| Monthly metrics | Monthly | 4 hours | Medium |
| Quarterly review | Quarterly | 8 hours | High |

### 2. Data Entry & Synchronization

- [ ] Evaluate integration platforms (Zapier, n8n, custom)
- [ ] Map data flows between systems
- [ ] Identify sync points and triggers
- [ ] Prototype key integrations

**Expected impact**: Reduce duplicate entry by 75%

### 3. Notification & Reminder Systems

```yaml
Automations to implement:
  - Due date reminders (3 days, 1 day, day-of)
  - Status change notifications
  - Approval request routing
  - Escalation workflows
```

### 4. Quality Checks

**Automated validation opportunities:**
- Document formatting compliance
- Required field completion
- Naming convention adherence
- Link validation
- Metadata consistency

## Discovery Phase

### Week 1-2: Research & Identification
1. Survey teams on repetitive tasks
2. Analyze time tracking data
3. Review existing automation attempts
4. Benchmark industry solutions

### Week 3-4: Feasibility Assessment
1. Evaluate technical requirements
2. Estimate development effort
3. Calculate ROI for top candidates
4. Prioritize automation projects

### Week 5-6: Proof of Concept
- Build 2-3 prototype automations
- Gather user feedback
- Measure time savings
- Refine approach

## Investment vs. Return

| Category | Time Investment | Annual Savings | ROI |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----|
| Reports | 40 hours | 400 hours | 10x |
| Data sync | 80 hours | 600 hours | 7.5x |
| Notifications | 20 hours | 200 hours | 10x |
| Quality checks | 60 hours | 300 hours | 5x |
| **Total** | **200 hours** | **1,500 hours** | **7.5x** |

## Risk Factors

> ⚠️ **Over-automation**: Not every process benefits from automation
> ⚠️ **Maintenance burden**: Automated systems require ongoing support
> ⚠️ **Change resistance**: Teams may prefer familiar manual processes
> ⚠️ **Technical debt**: Quick automations can become brittle

## Success Criteria

- *Proof of concept* completed with measurable time savings
- *Team satisfaction* with automated processes > 8/10
- *Automation roadmap* defined with prioritized projects
- *Maintenance plan* established for long-term sustainability

## Next Steps

1. Form automation task force
2. Create survey for teams
3. Set up tracking system for automation ideas
4. Schedule kickoff workshop
