# Epic: Organize Knowledge Base

This is just a sample tiki - feel free to remove!

## Context

Our knowledge base has grown organically over 3 years and now contains **1,200+ documents** with inconsistent organization, outdated content, and poor discoverability.

## Goals

1. **Findability**: Anyone can locate relevant information in < 2 minutes
2. **Accuracy**: All documents are current and reviewed within last 6 months
3. **Structure**: Clear hierarchy and consistent categorization
4. **Maintainability**: Defined ownership and update processes

## Proposed Structure

```
knowledge-base/
├── getting-started/
├── processes/
│   ├── development/
│   ├── operations/
│   └── support/
├── technical-guides/
├── policies/
└── archive/
```
