# Customization

tiki is highly customizable. `workflow.yaml` lets you define your workflow statuses, types, custom fields, and
the **views** that shape how documents are displayed and how you interact with them. Statuses define the
lifecycle stages tasks move through; views decide what you see on each screen (board lanes, list filters,
wiki pages, or a configured tiki detail view) and which keyboard actions are available. This section covers
both.

> **Version.** This reference describes the 0.6.0 `workflow.yaml` schema that ships with unified documents.
> Pre-0.6.0 `type: tiki` / `type: doki` plugins, `views: plugins:` wrappers, `fetcher:`/`url:`/`text:`, and
> `view: compact|expanded` are no longer accepted. See [Workflow format versions](../workflow-format.md)
> for the migration map and rejection-error table.

## Description

An optional top-level `description:` field in `workflow.yaml` describes what
the workflow is for. It supports multi-line text via YAML's block scalar (`|`)
and is used by `tiki workflow describe <name>` to preview a workflow before
installing it.

```yaml
description: |
  Release workflow. Coordinate feature rollout through
  Planned → Building → Staging → Canary → Released.
```

## Statuses

Workflow statuses are defined in `workflow.yaml` as a `fields:` entry named `status` with `type: enum`.
Every project must define status values here — there is no hardcoded fallback. See
[Custom statuses and types](custom-status-type.md). The default `workflow.yaml` ships with:

```yaml
fields:
  - name: status
    type: enum
    values:
      - value: backlog
        label: Backlog
        emoji: "📥"
        default: true
      - value: ready
        label: Ready
        emoji: "📋"
      - value: inProgress
        label: "In Progress"
        emoji: "⚙️"
      - value: review
        label: Review
        emoji: "👀"
      - value: done
        label: Done
        emoji: "✅"
```

Each enum value has:
- `value` — canonical identifier (camelCase recommended). Used in filters, actions, and frontmatter.
- `label` — display name shown in the UI (defaults to value when omitted).
- `emoji` — emoji shown alongside the label. Use this to mark "done"/"in progress" with a glyph
  (e.g. ✅ on the terminal value) — there is no separate `done:` flag.
- `default` — at most one value may carry `default: true`; that value is the creation default.

`status` is just an ordinary enum field — no value is special-cased by the runtime. All filters
and actions in view definitions must reference valid `value` keys.

## Types

Task types are defined in `workflow.yaml` as a `fields:` entry named `type` with `type: enum`. A missing
`type` field is an error. See [Custom statuses and types](custom-status-type.md) for the full validation
rules. The default `workflow.yaml` ships with:

```yaml
fields:
  - name: type
    type: enum
    values:
      - value: story
        label: Story
        emoji: "🌀"
      - value: bug
        label: Bug
        emoji: "💥"
      - value: spike
        label: Spike
        emoji: "🔍"
      - value: epic
        label: Epic
        emoji: "🗂️"
```

Each type has:
- `value` — canonical lowercase identifier. Used in filters, actions, and frontmatter.
- `label` — display name shown in the UI (defaults to key when omitted)
- `emoji` — emoji shown alongside the label

Mark one type `default: true` to use it as the creation default for new tikis.
If no type is marked, the first configured type wins.

## Task Creation Defaults

Creation defaults are derived from `workflow.yaml fields:`. Every field that declares a default
contributes one frontmatter key on capture:

- Enum fields apply the value marked `default: true` (typically `status: backlog`, `type: story`).
- Non-enum fields apply their declared `default:` value (e.g. `points: 1`,
  `tags: ["idea"]`).
- Fields with no declared default are absent from the captured frontmatter — the tiki only carries
  what the workflow asked for.

If the workflow declares no defaults at all, capture produces a tiki with only `id` and `title` —
useful for notes-only projects where piped input should be a plain document rather than a tracked
task.

```yaml
fields:
  - name: type
    type: enum
    values:
      - value: bug
        label: Bug
        emoji: "🐛"
        default: true
  - name: severity
    type: enum
    values:
      - value: critical
      - value: high
      - value: medium
        default: true
      - value: low
  - name: priority
    type: integer
    default: 3
```

## Views

Every screen in the tiki TUI is a **view**. Views are defined at the top level of `workflow.yaml` under a
`views:` list. Each view has a `kind:` that decides what it does:

| kind | purpose | required fields |
|---|---|---|
| `board` | kanban-style lanes with per-lane filters and move actions | `lanes:` |
| `list` | single-column list view | `lanes:` (typically one) |
| `wiki` | markdown viewer bound to a document by relative path | `path:` |
| `detail` | configurable single-tiki view: title, declared metadata fields, body | — |

Views are matched to keyboard shortcuts via `key:`, and at most one view may be marked `default: true` so
the TUI knows which screen to open on startup.

Here is a simple single-lane board called Backlog:

```yaml
views:
  - name: Backlog
    label: Backlog
    description: "Tasks waiting to be picked up, sorted by priority"
    kind: board
    key: "F3"
    lanes:
      - name: Backlog
        columns: 4
        filter: select where status = "backlog" and type != "epic" order by priority, id
    actions:
      - key: "b"
        label: "Add to board"
        action: update where id = id() set status="ready"
```

This shows every document in `status = "backlog"`, sorts by priority and then id, and arranges them visually
in 4 columns inside a single lane. The `actions:` list defines a keyboard shortcut `b` that moves the
selected document to the board by setting its status to `ready`.

A documentation view is simply a `kind: wiki` entry pointing at a relative Markdown file under `.doc/`:

```yaml
views:
  - name: Docs
    label: Docs
    description: "Project notes and documentation files"
    kind: wiki
    path: "index.md"
    key: "F2"
```

Path resolution is relative to `.doc/` — this example loads `.doc/index.md`. You can nest any depth:
`path: "architecture/index.md"` loads `.doc/architecture/index.md`.

### Multi-lane board

A board view with multiple lanes lets you move documents between lanes with `Shift-←`/`Shift-→`, just like
the main kanban. Each lane declares a `filter:` (a ruki `select` statement) and optionally an `action:` (a
ruki `update` statement that fires when a document is moved *into* the lane):

```yaml
views:
  - name: Custom
    label: Custom
    kind: board
    key: "F4"
    lanes:
      - name: Ready
        columns: 1
        width: 20
        filter: select where status = "ready" order by priority, title
        action: update where id = id() set status="ready"
      - name: In Progress
        columns: 1
        width: 30
        filter: select where status = "inProgress" order by priority, title
        action: update where id = id() set status="inProgress"
      - name: Review
        columns: 1
        width: 30
        filter: select where status = "review" order by priority, title
        action: update where id = id() set status="review"
      - name: Done
        columns: 1
        width: 20
        filter: select where status = "done" order by priority, title
        action: update where id = id() set status="done"
```

### Compact vs expanded

Board, list, and detail views all share a `layout:` field that declares the 2D grid of fields
composing the tiki card (for board/list) or layout box (for detail). `layout:` is **required** on
these view kinds:

```yaml
views:
  - name: Kanban
    kind: board
    layout:                       # required: the tiki-box layout shared by all lanes
      - ['type.visual + " " + id']
      - ["<highlight>title"]
      - ['"priority " + priority.visual']
    lanes:
      - name: Backlog
        filter: select where status = "backlog"
```

This replaces the pre-0.6.0 `mode: compact`/`mode: expanded` field, which is no longer accepted.
Cards render at the height implied by the layout's row count plus borders + padding.

### Detail views

A `kind: detail` view shows a single tiki: its title, a declared layout grid of fields, and its
description body. Description is always rendered. Title renders only if declared in the `layout:`
grid (typically with `<highlight>title`).

```yaml
views:
  - name: Detail
    kind: detail
    description: "Configured detail view for the selected tiki"
    require: ["selection:one"]
    layout:
      - [<highlight>title, --]
      - ["Status:", status]
      - ["Type:", type]
      - ["Priority:", priority]
```

Open a detail view by declaring a `kind: view` action that targets it. Because the action carries the
current selection, the target view receives the selected tiki id and renders it. The bundled kanban
workflow wires `Enter` this way:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: Enter
    label: Open
    kind: view
    view: Detail
    require: ["selection:one"]
```

#### `layout:` grid

`layout:` is a list of rows; each row is a list of cells. Cells can be field names, literal
captions (quoted strings), role-annotated fields (`<highlight>title`), composites
(`"priority " + priority.visual`), spans (`--`, `^`/`|`), or empty placeholders (`_`). The same
syntax is shared by board/list and detail views.

A bare field name sizes to its content. Add a sizing suffix to control width: `:N` pins a fixed
width, `:fr` lets the column grow to absorb extra space (`2fr` grows twice as fast as `1fr`), and
`:MIN..MAX` clamps any mode. A trailing `?` (e.g. `tags?`) hides the field and its caption when the
tiki has no value for it. See [workflow-format.md](../workflow-format.md) for the full cell
vocabulary and the ascending-floor shedding rule.

Any field declared in `workflow.yaml fields:` — plus the audit fields `createdBy`, `createdAt`,
`updatedAt` — may appear in `layout:`. Fields with typed editors (`status`, `type`, and `priority`
today) are fully editable in place on a detail view; all other accepted fields render as a generic
read-only `Label: value` row. Project-specific fields like `severity`, `sprint`, or `blocked`
therefore work in `layout:` without any code change.

Validation rules — workflow load fails when:

- An entry is not a workflow-declared field or a supported audit field
  (`createdBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
- For `kind: detail`, an entry is `id`, `description`, or `body` — those are rendered by the detail
  view chrome, not as layout rows. `title` IS allowed and renders as a regular grid field.
- For `kind: detail`, an entry is `filepath` or `path` — those values live on the tiki struct
  rather than in Fields and have no typed renderer yet.
- The grid has shape errors (ragged rows, orphan span markers) or a malformed sizing suffix.

Audit fields (`createdBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are accepted and render as read-only rows;
the bundled kanban workflow includes them in its `layout:` grid.

#### Detail view actions

Detail views accept their own `actions:` list, just like board and list views. Per-view actions
appear in the header alongside the built-in detail actions (Edit, Fullscreen, Edit source).

```yaml
views:
  - name: Detail
    kind: detail
    require: ["selection:one"]
    layout:
      - [<highlight>title, --]
      - ["Status:", status]
    actions:
      - key: "a"
        label: "Assign to me"
        action: update where id = id() set assignee=user()
```

Per-view actions register *after* the built-in detail actions, so picking a key already used by Edit,
Fullscreen, or Edit source will shadow the built-in. Choose unused keys unless you intend to replace
the built-in behavior.

#### Edit mode

Pressing `Edit` switches the same detail view into edit mode in place — there is no separate edit
view. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` traverse the editable layout fields in column-major order — down a
column top-to-bottom first, then on to the next column left-to-right. Read-only fields render but
are skipped during traversal. Save and cancel preserve the current edit-session behavior.

Fields whose semantic type has only a stub editor (everything other than `status`, `type`, and
`priority` today) render in edit mode but are skipped during traversal — pressing Tab walks past
them. This is intentional: a stub editor that swallowed focus would be confusing without a real
input widget behind it.

#### Project-specific fields in detail views

Any field declared in `workflow.yaml fields:` — including project-specific fields like
`severity`, `sprint`, or `blocked` — can appear in `layout:`. Fields without a typed editor
render as a generic read-only `Label: value` row, with the value formatted by the field's declared
type (lists are joined with commas, dates show as `YYYY-MM-DD`, enums show their `Label Emoji`,
absent values show as `—`). To set such a field, use a ruki action
(e.g. `update where id = id() set severity = input()`); typed in-place editors for additional
types will land in future iterations.

### Lane width

Each lane can optionally specify a `width` as a percentage (1-100) to control how much horizontal
space it occupies. Widths are relative proportions — they don't need to sum to 100. If width is
omitted, the lane gets an equal share of the remaining space.

```yaml
lanes:
  - name: Sidebar
    width: 25
  - name: Main
    width: 50
  - name: Details
    width: 25
```

If no lanes specify width, all lanes are equally sized (the default behavior).

### Global actions

You can define actions at the top level of `workflow.yaml` under `actions:`. Top-level actions are **global**
— they are available from every view:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "a"
    label: "Assign to me"
    kind: ruki
    action: update where id = id() set assignee=user()
  - key: F11
    kind: view
    label: "Open board"
    view: kanban          # name of a view declared below

views:
  - name: kanban
    kind: board
    ...
  - name: backlog
    kind: board
    ...
```

Two action kinds are supported at the top level:

- **`kind: ruki`** — executes a ruki statement (`update`, `select`, `delete`, …). This is the classic
  keyboard-shortcut behavior. The `action:` field carries the statement. When invoked from a wiki or
  detail view that received a selection via navigation, that selection threads into the ruki statement
  so `id()` resolves against it.
- **`kind: view`** — navigates to another view by name. The `view:` field names the target view. If the
  target is a `kind: detail` view (or otherwise requires a selection), the current selection is carried
  through and `require: ["selection:one"]` is honored.

When `kind:` is omitted, the parser infers it: `action:` set ⇒ `kind: ruki`, `view:` set ⇒ `kind: view`.

Global actions appear in the header alongside per-view actions. If a per-view action uses the same key as
a global action, the per-view action takes precedence for that view. There is no cross-file merging — the
single active workflow file wins.

### Per-view actions

In addition to lane actions (which fire when moving documents between lanes), each view can declare a
per-view `actions:` list. These shortcuts apply to the currently selected document and are displayed in the
header when the view is active.

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "b"
    label: "Add to board"
    action: update where id = id() set status="ready"
  - key: "a"
    label: "Assign to me"
    action: update where id = id() set assignee=user()
```

Each action has:
- `key` - a single printable character used as the keyboard shortcut
- `label` - description shown in the header and action palette
- `action` - a `ruki` statement (`update`, `create`, `delete`, or `select`)
- `hot` - (optional) controls header visibility. `hot: true` shows the action in the header,
  `hot: false` hides it. When absent, actions default to visible in the header. This does not affect
  the action palette — all actions are always discoverable via `?` regardless of the `hot` setting
- `input` - (optional) declares that the action prompts for user input before executing. The value is
  the scalar type of the input: `string`, `int`, `bool`, `date`, `timestamp`, or `duration`. The
  action's `ruki` statement must use `input()` to reference the value
- `require` - (optional) a list of context attributes the action needs to be enabled. When
  requirements are not met, the action is visible but greyed out in the header and palette, and its
  hotkey does nothing. See [Action requirements](#action-requirements) below

Example — keeping a verbose action out of the header but still accessible from the palette:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "x"
    label: "Archive and notify"
    action: update where id = id() set status="done"
    hot: false
```

When the shortcut key is pressed, the action is applied to the currently selected document.
For example, pressing `b` in the Backlog view changes the selected document's status to `ready`,
effectively moving it to the board.

`select` actions execute for side effects only — the output is ignored. They don't require a selected document.

### Input-backed actions

Actions with `input:` prompt the user for a value before executing. When the action key is pressed,
a modal input box opens with the action label as the prompt. The user types a value and presses
Enter to execute, or Esc to cancel.

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "A"
    label: "Assign to..."
    action: update where id = id() set assignee = input()
    input: string
  - key: "t"
    label: "Add tag"
    action: update where id = id() set tags = tags + input()
    input: string
  - key: "T"
    label: "Remove tag"
    action: update where id = id() set tags = tags - input()
    input: string
  - key: "p"
    label: "Set points"
    action: update where id = id() set points = input()
    input: int
  - key: "D"
    label: "Set due date"
    action: update where id = id() set due = input()
    input: date
```

Supported `input:` types: `string`, `int`, `bool`, `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `timestamp` (RFC3339 or
YYYY-MM-DD), `duration` (e.g. `2day`, `1week`).

Validation rules:
- An action with `input:` must use `input()` in its `ruki` statement
- An action using `input()` must declare `input:` — otherwise the workflow fails to load
- `input()` may only appear once per action

### Choose-backed actions

Actions using `choose()` open an interactive Quick Select document picker. The subquery inside
`choose()` determines which documents appear as candidates.

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "e"
    label: "Link to epic"
    action: update where id = choose(select where type = "epic") set dependsOn = dependsOn + id()
  - key: "l"
    label: "Add to epic"
    action: update where id = id() set dependsOn = dependsOn + choose(select where type != "epic")
```

When the shortcut key is pressed, the Quick Select modal opens with the filtered candidate list.
The user fuzzy-filters by typing, navigates with arrow keys, and confirms with Enter. Esc cancels
the operation.

Validation rules:
- `choose()` requires exactly one argument: a `select` subquery
- `choose()` may only appear once per action
- `choose()` and `input()` are mutually exclusive within a single action

### Action requirements

Actions can declare context requirements that control when they are enabled. Requirements are
evaluated against the current application. When any requirement is unmet, the action is disabled.


```yaml
actions:
  - key: "c"
    label: "Chat about task"
    action: select where id = id() | run("claude -p 'Discuss: $1'")
    require: ["ai", "id"]
```

This action requires both `ai` (an AI agent configured in `config.yaml`) and `id` (a task selected in the current view).

#### Built-in context attributes

| Attribute | Set when |
|-----------|----------|
| `id` | Exactly one task is selected — legacy alias for `selection:one` |
| `selection:one` | Exactly one task is selected |
| `selection:any` | One or more tasks are selected |
| `selection:many` | Two or more tasks are selected |
| `ai` | `ai.agent` is configured in `config.yaml` |
| `view:<view-id>` | Identifies the currently active view (e.g. `view:plugin:Kanban`) |

`id` and `selection:one` are equivalent; both require exactly one selected task. Prefer whichever reads better in
context — `id` is shorter, `selection:one` is symmetric with the other cardinality tokens.

#### Auto-inference

Tiki infers selection requirements from the ruki statement so authors rarely need to declare them explicitly:

- Using `id()` auto-infers `id` (equivalent to `selection:one`).
- Using `ids()` auto-infers `selection:any` — the action requires at least one selection but accepts any
  cardinality above that. Override with an explicit `require:` entry (e.g. `["selection:many"]`) when you want to
  constrain further.
- Using `selected_count()` does **not** auto-infer anything. The builtin exists so ruki can branch on cardinality
  (including the zero case), and auto-inferring `selection:any` would make the zero branch unreachable. Authors
  who want gating should add an explicit `require:` entry.

Explicitly listing an auto-inferred requirement is allowed but redundant.

#### Multi-selection actions

Use `ids()` in the ruki statement to operate on every selected task:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "D"
    label: "Mark selected done"
    action: update where id in ids() set status = "done"
```

This action inherits `selection:any`, so it is enabled as soon as at least one task is selected. To require two or
more selected tasks (e.g. a merge operation), add `require: ["selection:many"]` explicitly.

#### Bulk actions

Mutating actions (`update`, `delete`) that do *not* use `id()` or `ids()` are bulk actions — they operate on all
matching tasks, not just the selected ones. Bulk actions remain enabled even when nothing is selected:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "X"
    label: "Delete all done"
    action: delete where status = "done"
```

This action has no selection requirement (neither explicit nor inferred) so it stays enabled regardless of
selection state.

#### Negated requirements

Prefix a requirement with `!` to require that the attribute is *absent*. In YAML, negated requirements must be quoted:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "K"
    label: "Go to Kanban"
    action: select where status = "ready"
    require: ["!view:plugin:Kanban"]
```

This action is disabled when the user is already on the Kanban view — the `view:plugin:Kanban`
attribute would be present, failing the `!view:plugin:Kanban` check.

### ruki expressions

View filters, lane actions, and per-view/global actions all use the [ruki](../ruki/index.md)
language. Filters use `select` statements. Actions support `update`, `create`, `delete`, and
`select` statements (`select` for side effects only, output ignored).

#### Filter (select)

The `filter` field uses a `ruki` `select` statement to determine which documents appear in a lane.
Sorting is part of the select — use `order by` to control display order.

```sql
-- basic filter with sort
select where status = "backlog" and type != "epic" order by priority, id

-- recent items, most recent first
select where now() - updatedAt < 24hour order by updatedAt desc

-- multiple conditions
select where type = "epic" and status = "backlog" and priority > "high" order by priority, points desc

-- assigned to me
select where assignee = user() order by priority
```

#### Action (update)

The `action` field uses a `ruki` `update` statement. In view context, `id()` refers to the currently selected document.

```sql
-- set status on move
update where id = id() set status="ready"

-- set multiple fields
update where id = id() set status="backlog" priority="medium-high"

-- assign to current user
update where id = id() set assignee=user()
```

#### Supported fields

- `id` - document identifier (bare 6-char uppercase, e.g. `"M7N2XK"`)
- `title` - task title text
- `type` - task type (must match a key defined in `workflow.yaml` types)
- `status` - workflow status (must match a key defined in `workflow.yaml` statuses)
- `assignee` - assigned user
- `priority` - workflow enum (e.g. `"high"`, `"medium-high"`, `"medium"`, `"medium-low"`, `"low"` in the bundled kanban; declared in `workflow.yaml`)
- `points` - story points estimate
- `tags` - list of tags
- `dependsOn` - list of document ids this document depends on
- `due` - due date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `recurrence` - recurrence pattern (cron format)
- `createdAt` - creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` - last update timestamp

#### Conditions

- **Comparison**: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not` (precedence: not > and > or)
- **Membership**: `"value" in field`, `status not in ["done", "cancelled"]`
- **Emptiness**: `assignee is empty`, `tags is not empty`
- **Quantifiers**: `dependsOn any status != "done"`, `dependsOn all status = "done"`
- **Grouping**: parentheses `()` to control evaluation order

#### Literals and built-ins

- Strings: double-quoted (`"ready"`, `"alex"`)
- Integers: `1`, `5`
- Dates: `2026-03-25`
- Durations: `2hour`, `14day`, `3week`, `1month`
- Lists: `["bug", "frontend"]`
- `user()` — current `tiki` identity (configured `identity.name` or `identity.email` → git user → OS user)
- `now()` — current timestamp
- `id()` — currently selected document (in view context)
- `input()` — user-supplied value (in actions with `input:` declaration)
- `choose(select where ...)` — interactively pick a task from Quick Select
- `count(select where ...)` — count matching documents

For the full language reference, see the [ruki documentation](../ruki/index.md).
